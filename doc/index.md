First prototype of the audio-streamer with amplifier and speaker.

## Summary

The aim of this hardware project is to enable high-end audio equipment to play audio from streaming sources. Therefore, the audio-streamer is build with high-quality components. The modular concept allows the user/developer to change parts of the streamer to test different hardware components or to adjust the hardware to the users taste. The audio-streamer can be used with a touch-screen or as headless in HiFi rack.
